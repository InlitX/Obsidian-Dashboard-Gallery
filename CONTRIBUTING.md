## 📁 Required file structure

Your dashboard must follow this naming convention:

```
├── dashboard-your-dashboard-name.md    # # Dashboard markdown file
└── .obsidian/snippets/
    └── dashboard-your-dashboard-name.css # CSS file (if applicable)
```

**Important:** 
- Use the prefix `dashboard-` followed by the name
- No spaces, use hyphens (`-`) to separate words
- If your dashboard requires CSS, place it in the `.obsidian/snippets/` folder
